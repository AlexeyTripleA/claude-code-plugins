# Security Hint

Lightweight security awareness for conversations. Provides quick hints about potential security issues without full analysis.

## When to activate

Activate when you notice in code being discussed:
- SQL queries using string concatenation
- Hardcoded passwords, API keys, tokens
- User input rendered without escaping
- `eval()` or dynamic code execution
- Sensitive data in `console.log`
- Missing authentication checks
- File paths from user input

## What to do

**Briefly mention** the concern in 1-2 sentences, then suggest running a command:

**Example responses:**

```
"I see SQL string concatenation on line 23, which could allow SQL injection.
Run `/review src/api/` to check for security vulnerabilities."
```

```
"There's a hardcoded API key on line 8. Consider moving it to environment variables.
Run `/quick-check src/config.js` for security scan."
```

```
"This code renders user input without escaping (line 34), potential XSS risk.
Run `/deep-review` for comprehensive security analysis."
```

## Important rules

- ❌ Do NOT perform full security audit
- ❌ Do NOT scan entire codebase
- ✅ Only mention issues you can see in the current conversation
- ✅ Keep hints brief (1-2 sentences)
- ✅ Always suggest a command for full analysis
- ✅ Be helpful, not alarmist

## Commands to suggest

- `/quick-check` - for fast security scan
- `/review [file]` - for specific file review
- `/deep-review` - for comprehensive analysis

This is a hint tool, not a replacement for proper security review.
